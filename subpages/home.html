        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio page!</h3>
        <br/> My name is <b>Dave</b>, known recently under the online nickname <b>"Skydusk"</b> in the vast sea of the internet.
        <br/> As of this very moment, I am a <b>sprite artist, mod developer, data analytic and designer.</b>
        <br/> I am proficient in <b>Lua, C/C++, C#, R, Python and HTML/CSS/JS.</b>
        <br/>
        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <br/> Since I was merely an 8-year-old kid in the late 2000s, I started to discover various content creation tools for games I played at that time.
        <br/> Be it level editors for various flash games found on the web or a little bit later discovering my love for creating new things in Minecraft in it's "golden age". 
        <br/> Throughout the years as an avid gamer, I used to create a lot of things that I no longer even remember with how much I created.
        <br/> My little experiments let me into various ends with <b>Unity, Source 1 Games, Quake, Doom, Minecraft, and Skyrim.</b>
        <br/> So much, I remember creating texture packs, levels, sprites and eventually even scripts, and tools and it led to the creation of the game engine I am developing.
        <br/> That's not all! The academic experience that made me delve into GIS and CAD software in various civil engineering or geoinformatics exercises helped me in my design journey,
        <br/>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <br/> Outside of mod development into games or literal game development. I am keeping up with a lot of tech news, as I am very much interested in PC hardware development and in case all the advancements.
        <br/> I enjoy video content creation as well, be it video editing or shooting the footage. Or even helping out with a lot of projects by providing feedback in the tangible and most valuable way I can.
        <br/> Not exactly into mass majority of movies, games or shows, but if something interests me a lot, I am willing to even read the source material to digest the smallest details.
        <br/> Western or Eastern, doesn't matter to me. Be it Re Zero or even Red Dwarf. I am not a couch potato however, even though my passion runs wild, I do enjoy exploring the outside world by hours long walks, even some winter sports like cross-country skiing and swimming can be found on my lists of interests.
